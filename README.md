# B-tree-algorithm---File-Processing
# Programming Language: JAVA

This project is about constructing and searching a file in the disk , the data of which are saved using the b+ tree algorithm. B+ trees are a special version B trees which allows range search.

Just like B trees, B+ trees consist of two different node types, the inner-nodes and the leaf-nodes. 

This project implements : 
- Binary file creation.
- Initialization of binary file, filling it with data saved using the b+ tree algorithm.
- Search of the file for specific element/key.
